# odin-cs_binary_search_trees

This is the fifteenth project to work in the "JavaScript Course"

## The experience I get in this project

(2025/07/14) I complete this project with knowledges of JavaScript I learned in the previous course. I use Javascript concepts such as class, array, recursion, binary search tree to build Tree class and other methods to tackle with the binary search tree problem. With advices in Assignment of the project, I try seperate classes of Node and Tree in `classes.js`. I also add basic methods for Tree such as insert, deleteItem, find, traversal, isBalanced, rebalance and so on. In Some methods such as traversals, I try different ways to design the algorithm with iteration and recursion skills. Futhermore, I use Node.js command environment to run and debug my classes in `main.js`. This activity strengthens my skills in Node.js and JavaScript.
